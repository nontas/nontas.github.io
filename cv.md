I am a Research Assistant/PhD student in the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) working at the [Intelligent Behaviour Understanding Group (iBUG)](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Dr. Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). I received my Diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [National Technical University of Athens](http://www.ntua.gr/) in 2011. During 2011-2012, I was a Research Assistant in the [Computer Vision, Speech Communication & Signal Processing (CVSP) Group](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Petros Maragos](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/maragos/index.shtm).


My research interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Statistical Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. I specialise on 2D Deformable Models with particular focus on developing methods for accurate and robust landmark localisation, as well as the unsupervised construction of deformable models that are efficient under unconstrained conditions. I have also worked on the task of facial events detection for automatic Sign Language Recognition.
