Since February 2017, I am a <i>Computer Vision Research Scientist</i> at the [Amazon Development Center](http://www.amazon.jobs/location/berlin-germany) in Berlin, Germany. Before that, during 2012-2017, I did my Ph.D. and worked as a Research Assistant in the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) at the [Intelligent Behaviour Understanding Group (iBUG)](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Dr. Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). I received my Diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [National Technical University of Athens](http://www.ntua.gr/) in 2011. During 2011-2012, I was a Research Assistant in the [Computer Vision, Speech Communication & Signal Processing (CVSP) Group](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/) under the supervision of [Prof. Petros Maragos](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/maragos/index.shtm).


My research interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision and Statistical Machine Learning. I specialize on 2D Deformable Models with particular focus on developing methods for accurate and robust landmark localization, as well as the unsupervised construction of deformable models that are efficient under unconstrained conditions. I have also worked on the task of facial events detection for automatic Sign Language Recognition.
