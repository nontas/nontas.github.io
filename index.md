<p align="justify">My name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas">Epameinondas</a> or simply <i>Nontas</i>.<br/><br/>

Since July 2018, I am an <i>Applied Scientist</i> and <i>Manager</i> of the <i>Robotics team</i> at <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/"><b>Amazon</b></a> in Berlin, Germany.
