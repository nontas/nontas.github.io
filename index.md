<p align="justify">My name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epaminondas">Epameinondas</a> or simply <i>Nontas</i>. I am a Computer Vision Research Engineer
at <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/location/berlin-germany"><b>Amazon</b></a> in Berlin.<br/><br/>

My research interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision and Statistical Machine Learning. I did my Ph.D. at <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Imperial College London</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/">Dr. Stefanos Zafeiriou</a> with particular focus on <i>2D Deformable Models</i>.<br/><br/>

I co-founded the <a href="http://www.menpo.org/"><b>Menpo Project</b></a> with my friends <a href="https://github.com/jalabort"><i>Joan Alabort-i-Medina</i></a>, <a href="http://www.jamesabooth.com/"><i>James Booth</i></a> and <a href="http://patricksnape.github.io/"><i>Patrick Snape</i></a>. Menpo is a set of open source, cross-platform Python frameworks and associated tooling that provide end-to-end solutions for 2D and 3D deformable modeling.</p>
