I am a Research Assistant/PhD student at [**Imperial College London**](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing). I am a member of the [**Intelligent Behaviour Understanding Group (iBUG)**](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/) working under the supervision of [*Dr. Stefanos Zafeiriou*](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/).<br/><br/>
My research interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Statistical Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction with particular focus on **2D Deformable Models**.<br/><br/>
I co-founded the **[Menpo Project](http://www.menpo.org/)** with my friends [*Joan Alabort-i-Medina*](https://github.com/jalabort), [*James Booth*](http://www.jamesabooth.com/) and [*Patrick Snape*](http://patricksnape.github.io/). Menpo is an open source, cross-platform library for training and fitting deformable models.
